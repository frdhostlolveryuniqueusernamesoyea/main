<title>Q&A | FrDomains</title>

<p><strong>Where do you host your site?</strong> <br> Vercel.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>How did you think about creating FrDomains?</strong> <br> Well, NoIP offers the same, but only 1 record per subdomain. We want to help people with free subdomains.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>What did you pay for?</strong> <br> I think only the domain.</p>
